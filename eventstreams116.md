# Using Kafka console tools with {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}
{: #kafka_console_tools }

Apache Kafka comes with a variety of console tools for simple administration and messaging operations. You can use many of them with {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}, although {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} does not permit connection to its ZooKeeper cluster. As Kafka has developed, many of the tools that previously required connection to ZooKeeper no longer have that requirement.
{: shortdesc}

You can find these console tools in the <code>bin</code> directory of your Kafka download. You can download a client from [Apache Kafka downloads ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://kafka.apache.org/downloads){:new_window}.

To provide the SASL credentials to these tools, create a properties file based on the following example:

<pre>
<code>
  sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username="USER" password="PASSWORD";
  security.protocol=SASL_SSL
  sasl.mechanism=PLAIN
  ssl.protocol=TLSv1.2
  ssl.enabled.protocols=TLSv1.2
  ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm=HTTPS
</code>
</pre>
{:codeblock}

Replace USER and PASSWORD with the values from your {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} **Service Credentials** tab in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console.


## Console producer
{: #console_producer }

You can use the Kafka console producer tool with {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}. You must provide a list of brokers and SASL credentials.

After you've created the properties file as described previously, you can run the console producer in a terminal as follows:

<pre>
<code>
  $ kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list KAFKA_BROKERS_SASL --producer.config CONFIG_FILE --topic TOPIC_NAME
</code>
</pre>
{:codeblock}

Replace the following variables in the example with your own values:
* KAFKA_BROKERS_SASL with the value from your {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} **Service Credentials** tab in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, as a list of host:port pairs separated with commas (for example, `host1:port1,host2:port2`). 
* CONFIG_FILE with the path of the configuration file. 

You can use many of the other options of this tool, with the exception of those that require access to ZooKeeper.


## Console consumer
{: #console_consumer }

You can use the Kafka console consumer tool with {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}. You must provide a bootstrap server and SASL credentials.

After you've created the properties file as described previously, you can run the console consumer in a terminal as follows:

<pre>
<code>
  $ kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server KAFKA_BROKERS_SASL --consumer.config CONFIG_FILE --topic TOPIC_NAME 
</code>
</pre>
{:codeblock}

Replace the following variables in the example with your own values:
* KAFKA_BROKERS_SASL with the value from your {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} **Service Credentials** tab in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, as a list of host:port pairs separated with commas (for example, `host1:port1,host2:port2`). 
* CONFIG_FILE with the path of the configuration file. 

You can use many of the other options of this tool, with the exception of those that require access to ZooKeeper.


## Consumer groups
{: #consumer_groups_tool }

You can use the Kafka consumer groups tool with {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}. Because {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} does not permit connection to its ZooKeeper cluster, some of the options are not available.

After you've created the properties file as described previously, you can run the consumer groups tools in a terminal. For example, you can list the consumer groups as follows:

<pre>
<code>
  $ kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server KAFKA_BROKERS_SASL --command-config CONFIG_FILE --list
</code>
</pre>
{:codeblock}

Replace the following variables in the example with your own values:
* KAFKA_BROKERS_SASL with the value from your {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} **Service Credentials** tab in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, as a list of host:port pairs separated with commas (for example, `host1:port1,host2:port2`). 
* CONFIG_FILE with the path of the configuration file.

Using this tool, you can also display details like the current positions of the consumers, their lag, and client-id for each partition for a group. For example:

<pre>
<code>
  $ kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server KAFKA_BROKERS_SASL --command-config CONFIG_FILE --describe --group GROUP
</code>
</pre>
{:codeblock}

Replace GROUP in the example with the group name that you want to retrieve details for. 

Here is some sample output from running the **kafka-consumer-groups** tool:
<pre>
<code>
GROUP              TOPIC    PARTITION  CURRENT-OFFSET  LOG-END-OFFSET  LAG         CONSUMER-ID      HOST          CLIENT-ID
consumer-group-1   foo        0          264             267            3          client-1-abc    example.com    client-1
consumer-group-1   foo        1          124             124            0          client-1-abc    example.com    client-1
consumer-group-1   foo        2          212             212            0          client-2-def    example.com    client-2
</code>
</pre>
{:codeblock}

From the example above, you can see consumer group `consumer-group-1` has 2 consumer members consuming messages from topic `foo` with 3 partitions. It also shows that the consumer `client-1-abc` that is consuming from partition `0` is 3 messages behind, because the current offset of the consumer is `264` but the offset of the last message on partition `0` is `267`. 
## Topics
{: #topics_tool }

You can use the **kafka-topics** tool with {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}. Ensure that you use V2.6 of the tool, because it does not require Zookeeper access.

A scenario where you might want to use **kafka-topics** is to find out information about your topics and their configuration in an existing cluster, so that you can recreate them in a new cluster. You can use the information that is output from **kafka-topics** to create the same named topics in the new cluster. For more information about how to create topics, see [Using the administration Kafka Java client API](/docs/EventStreams?topic=EventStreams-kafka_java_api) or the 
[ibmcloud es topic-create command](/docs/EventStreams?topic=EventStreams-cli_reference#ibmcloud_es). Alternatively, you can also use the IBM {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} console.

Here is some sample output from running the **kafka-topics** tool:

```
~/kafka_2.12-2.6.0 $ bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server kafka03-prod01.messagehub.services.us-south.bluemix.net:9093 --command-config vcurr_dal06.properties --describe

Topic:sample-topic	PartitionCount:3	ReplicationFactor:3	 Configs:min.insync.replicas=2,unclean.leader.election.enable=true,retention.bytes=1073741824,segment.bytes=536870912,retention.ms=86400000
    Topic: sample-topic    Partition: 0    Leader: 0    Replicas: 0,2,1    Isr: 0,2,1
    Topic: sample-topic    Partition: 1    Leader: 1    Replicas: 1,2,0	   Isr: 0,2,1
    Topic: sample-topic    Partition: 2    Leader: 2    Replicas: 2,1,0	   Isr: 0,2,1
Topic:testtopic	 PartitionCount:1	 ReplicationFactor:3	Configs:min.insync.replicas=2,unclean.leader.election.enable=true,retention.bytes=1073741824,segment.bytes=536870912,retention.ms=86400000
    Topic: testtopic    Partition: 0    Leader: 0    Replicas: 0,2,1   Isr: 0,2
```
{: codeblock}

From the sample above, you can see that topic `sample-topic` has 3 partitions and a replication factor of 3. The example also shows which broker the leader of each partitions is on and which replicas are in sync (`Isr`). For example, the leader of partition `0`  is on broker `0`, the followers are on brokers `2` and `1` and all 3 replicas are in sync. If you look at the second topic `testtopic`, it has only 1 partition, replicated on brokers `0`, `2` and `1` but the in-sync replica list only shows `0` and `2`. This means the follower on broker `1` is falling behind and is therefore not in the `Isr` list. 


## Kafka Streams reset
{: #kafka_streams_reset }

You can use this tool with {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} to reset the processing state of a Kafka Streams application, so you can reprocess its input from scratch. Before you run this tool, ensure that your Streams application is fully stopped.

For example:

<pre>
<code>
  $ kafka-streams-application-reset.sh --bootstrap-servers KAFKA_BROKERS_SASL --config-file CONFIG_FILE --application-id APP_ID
</code>
</pre>
{:codeblock}

Replace the following variables in the example with your own values:
* KAFKA_BROKERS_SASL with the value from your {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} **Service Credentials** tab in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, as a list of host:port pairs separated with commas (like `host1:port1,host2:port2`). 
* CONFIG_FILE with the path of the configuration file. 
* APP_ID with your Streams application ID.
